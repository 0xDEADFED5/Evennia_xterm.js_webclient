Input functions

Input functions are always called from the client (they handle server
input, hence the name).

This module is loaded by being included in the
`settings.INPUT_FUNC_MODULES` tuple.

All *global functions* included in this module are considered
input-handler functions and can be called by the client to handle
input.

An input function must have the following call signature:

    cmdname(session, *args, **kwargs)

Where session will be the active session and *args, **kwargs are extra
incoming arguments and keyword properties.

A special command is the "default" command, which is will be called
when no other cmdname matches. It also receives the non-found cmdname
as argument.

    default(session, cmdname, *args, **kwargs)

        session.update_flags(SCREENWIDTH={0: args[0]}, SCREENHEIGHT={0: args[1]})
